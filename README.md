# ElLibro

1. Description

    ElLibro is an online library system. Designed to aid the users of a library by providing valuable information about its volumes, current state of books or any other pieces of information library deems important. Users will be able to find the details about the books they are looking for, state their opinions and share reviews of the works, interact with each other etc. 

2. Purpose

    ElLibro system is intended for "Chwałowicki Klub Książki" (which will be reflected in its front page). The core of the system however should be universal and easy to retrofit by anyone to fit their own desire. ElLibro is not groundbreaking in any way, but is going to have some characteristics many may find quite handy - ElLibro will stay simple in use, simple to modify and not demanding from the technical standpoint (all of which are important for small libraries which don't want to invest in commercial alternatives). With that in mind I hope my system will prove useful to at least one local library. 

3. Language

    Parts of code which will interact with a user are going to be in polish. This is caused by the library for which ElLibro is intended (more about it in section 2. Purpose). Some of the code may be in spanish, because author of the program has recently started learning this language and it is his way of revising the vocabulary. The author is deeply sorry for any inconvenience it may cause.

4. Goals

    + Allow users to create accounts.
    + Improving general looks of the website.
    + Creation of reviews module.
    + Creation of notifications module.
    + Create Librarian group which will be allowed to add new books to the database without all the admin's permissions.

5. Progress

    Development (started on 16/10/19) is still in its early stages, so many of the functionalities are still missing, but that will be fixed over time in the upcoming updates. I hope I will not be keeping anyone waiting for too long and promise development as fast as student's life allows.
